INTRODUCTION                                    *vim-pipe*

vim-pipe sends the current buffer to a shell command, and instantly displays
the output.

EXAMPLE                                         *vim-pipe-example*

Vim-pipe uses an external program to process your file, and then shows you the
output. It works with any command that accepts the file on STDIN and displays
the result on STDOUT. So anything like this:

    $ cat myfile | someprogram arg arg | less

PostgreSQL's client works like that, so when editing a database query, you can
add something like this in your .vimrc file:

    autocmd FileType sql let b:vimpipe_command="psql mydatabase"

Then edit an SQL file, and hit <LocalLeader>r to instant execute the query and
see the results. Your development cycle is now down to 2 keystokes.

CONFIGURATION                                   *vim-pipe-configuration*

All configuration is done on a per-buffer basis. The easiest way is to set
these up with an |autocmd| in .vimrc. See the |vim-pipe-example| above.

                                                *vim-pipe-b:vimpipe_command*

b:vimpipe_command       Set this to any shell command that will take the
			            contents of your buffer on STDIN, and return the
                        result on STDOUT.

                                                *vim-pipe-b:vimpipe_filetype*

b:vimpipe_filetype      The filetype of the output buffer. Useful for
                        syntax highlighting of the result, or running
                        arbitrary autocommands against it.

g:vimpipe_silent        Set to 1 to suppress all additional output (runtime information).
                        Useful if you want to reuse the output buffer without
                        having to clean up.

g:vimpipe_invoke_map    The keystroke that invokes vim-pipe. Default: <LocalLeader>r

g:vimpipe_close_map     The keystroke that closes the vim-pipe window. Default: <LocalLeader>p

COMMANDS                                        *vim-pipe-commands*

<LocalLeader>r          Send the contents of the current buffer to the
                        |vim-pipe-b:pipe_command|and display the results.
                        The buffer does not need to be saved first.

<LocalLeader>p          Close the result buffer. May be called from your
                        buffer or the vim-pipe result buffer.
