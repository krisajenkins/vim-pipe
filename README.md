# Vim Pipe - A Productivity-Boosting Plugin

## Do you do this?

```
        hack <---------- alt-tab <---------- react
          |                                    |
+-------------------+                +-------------------+
| code code         |                | result result     |
| code              |                | result            |
|                   |                |                   |
|                   |                |                   |
|                   |                |                   |
|                   |                |                   |
|                   |                |                   |
+-------------------+                +-------------------+
          |                                    |
         :w -----------> alt-tab ---------> invoke
```

This plugin lets you do this instead:

```
+-------------------+
| code code         |
| code              |---------\
|                   |         |
|-------------------|   <LocalLeader>r
| result result     |         |
| result            |<--------/
|                   |
+-------------------+
```

Which saves tonnes of time. It's even faster than using screen or tmux.

It's useful for developing SQL queries, fast HTML previews, markdown-checking,
and anything that needs to pass through a shell command while you develop.

## Detail

You associate a shell command with your file, something that will take your
buffer on STDIN and show the result on STDOUT. For example, if you're editing an
SQL query, that command might be `psql mydatabase`.

Having done that, `<LocalLeader>r` will run the current buffer against that
command and show you the results. You no longer need to
save-switch-execute-switch, which makes life faster and easier.

## Installation

* Install [Pathogen][pathogen]. (You're already using Pathogen, right?)
* Clone this project into `~/.vim/bundle/vim-pipe`.
* Set a `b:vimpipe_command` variable for your buffer. The easiest way is to add
a `let` command in `~/.vim/ftplugin/<filetype>.vim`. For example:

```vim
" In ~/.vim/ftplugin/sql.vim
let b:vimpipe_command="psql mydatabase"
" In ~/.vim/ftplugin/markdown.vim
let b:vimpipe_command="multimarkdown"
```

See below for various examples.

## Usage & Tips

Once `b:vimpipe_command` is configured, type `<LocalLeader>r` to get the list
results.  There's no need to save the file first. It works on the current
buffer, not the contents on disk.

### PostgreSQL
```vim
" In ~/.vim/ftplugin/sql.vim
let b:vimpipe_command="psql mydatabase"
```

See also [vim-postgresql-syntax][vim-postgresql-syntax].

### Oracle

If you have an OPS$ login, it's as simple as:
```vim
" In ~/.vim/ftplugin/sql.vim
let b:vimpipe_command="sqlplus -s /"
```

### HTML

This is only text-based, obviously, but can still speed up initial development.

```vim
" In ~/.vim/ftplugin/html.vim
let b:vimpipe_command="lynx -dump -stdin"
```

### JavaScript

I usually run JavaScript in a browser, so I bind vim-pipe to JSLint, for
code-quality checking on-the-fly.

```vim
" In ~/.vim/ftplugin/javascript.vim
let b:vimpipe_command='jslint <(cat)'
```

Note: JSLint doesn't accept input on STDIN, so this configuration uses bash's
virtual file support. `<(cat)` takes the STDIN and re-presents it to look like a
regular file.

### JSON

I find attaching vim-pipe to a pretty-printer useful for development:

```vim
" Vim doesn't set a FileType for JSON, so we'll do it manually:
" In ~/.vimrc
autocmd BufNewFile,BufReadPost *.json setlocal filetype=javascript.json

" In ~/.vim/ftplugin/javascript.vim
" Requires that you have Python v2.6+ installed. (Most *nix systems do.)
let b:vimpipe_command="python -m json.tool"
```

### Markdown

Fast-preview the HTML:

```vim
" In ~/.vim/ftplugin/markdown.vim
let b:vimpipe_command="multimarkdown"
let b:vimpipe_filetype="html"
```

Or combine wth the HTML tip to preview the rendered result:

```vim
" In ~/.vim/ftplugin/markdown.vim
let b:vimpipe_command="multimarkdown | lynx -dump -stdin"
```

### MongoDB

Is there an official FileType for MongoDB query files? Let's say it's `mongoql`, for all files `*.mql`:

```vim
" In ~/.vimrc
autocmd BufNewFile,BufReadPost *.mql setlocal filetype=mongoql

" In ~/.vim/ftplugin/mql.vim
let b:vimpipe_command="mongo"
let b:vimpipe_filetype="javascript"
```

Then try editing a file called `somequery.mql` with something like this in:

```javascript
use books;
db.book.find(null, {author: 1, title: 1 });
db.runCommand({dbStats: 1});
```

## Help

See `:help vim-pipe` for more.

## FAQ

### What's the difference between this and `:make`?

The biggest difference is the way the output is presented & read. If the whole of the
output is interesting, use Vim Pipe. If the only interesting part of the output
is a summary of errors/warnings, use `:make`.

### Does Vim Pipe fork/exec?

_..or is there a long-lived background process?_

It forks. So it works well with commands you'd invoke frequently from the
command line, but not so well with something like `javac`, which has a (deathly)
slow startup time.
